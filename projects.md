This project sets up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment of containerized applications. It integrates Docker for container management and deploys applications to a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring continuous integration and rapid deployment.

## [Chaos Engineering with Gremlin](https://chrischiedo.github.io/rust-for-java-devs/) - Kubernetes Chaos Experiments with Gremlin

This project uses Gremlin to conduct chaos engineering experiments on a Kubernetes cluster. It runs a CPU stress test on random pods in a namespace, allowing for resilience testing by simulating high CPU load and monitoring system behavior under failure scenarios.
