My background is in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I specifically majored in Computer Engineering, which was offered as a sub-discipline in the EE department.

I have spent a good chunk of my professional life working in the technical training space: as a software development trainer, electrical engineering instructor, a technical curriculum developer, and a technical content developer. I have also served as a Head of Department (ICT and Engineering) in a technical training institute.

A couple of years ago I decided to transition into the software engineering space. I am mainly interested in distributed systems and programming languages/compilers. Over the years, I've worked with Java, Python, and Rust.

My most recent work as a developer was working for a large insurance brokerage firm as a software engineer consultant (short-term contract). I was part of a team that worked on an insurance claims application (I specifically worked on the cards management service). The app was based on a microservices architecture, with about 25 different services. Some of the technologies that we used are: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, RabbitMQ, Liquibase, Camunda (business workflow automation), ArgoCD, Azure DevOps, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

I've previously worked at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) as a Technical Content Developer. I was employee number 1 on the Nairobi [Identity platform documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/) team. I consequently became the "unofficial" Nairobi team lead. In this capacity, I developed the onboarding manual that was used to onboard new team members (the team had grown to 8 members when I left). I also offered mentorship to junior team members.

I've also worked at [Andela](https://www.andela.com/) as a software development technical trainer (as a member of the Bootcamp training team).

Prior to shifting into the industry, I worked in the academia, as an engineering instructor/lecturer at [Zetech University](https://zetech.ac.ke/).

I am currently pursuing a part-time Master’s degree in Computer Science at 
the [University of Nairobi](https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/), School of Computing and Informatics.

I'm naturally a very curious person, and I particularly enjoy learning new things every day. I feel energized when working with small, highly motivated teams that care deeply about delivering business results.
